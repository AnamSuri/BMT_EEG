# BMT_EEG
This repository provides data and code for the paper entitled: "BMT_EEG: A Novel EEG Dataset to study the influence of novel protocol on mental task classification and authentication systems".
Here, we have developed model for Mental Task Classification and Biometric Authentication Systems. The architecture of the proposed model consisting of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) and Gated Recurrent units (GRUs) is given below:
